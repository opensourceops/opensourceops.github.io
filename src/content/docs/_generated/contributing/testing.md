The canonical command is:

```console
cargo xtask verify
```

User-journey layers are separate:

```console
cargo xtask acceptance
cargo xtask acceptance-container
cargo xtask acceptance-live-openai  # explicit credentialed gate only
cargo xtask package
cargo xtask secret-scan
```

It checks rustfmt; clippy with all targets/features and warnings denied; locked build; unit, integration, compatibility, provider, protocol, persistence, runtime, and security tests; rustdoc; generated schema/CLI consistency; all workflow validation and deterministic examples; negative capability/policy/no-mutation cases; dependency sources/licenses/advisories; repository secret patterns and immutable workflow action pins; `cargo install`; and the Rust-only production boundary.

Unit tests cover parser diagnostics, strictness, compiler order/cycles/capabilities, templates, tool schemas, policy traversal/network/redaction, state transitions, effect recovery, store migration/corruption/checkpoints, runtime dataflow/check/diff/approval/cancellation/replay/fork, provider mappings, protocols, and traces. `proptest` exercises arbitrary templates and typed preservation. Language-neutral fixtures in `fixtures/compat` preserve the TypeScript oracle’s external graph/dataflow contract.

`fuzz/` contains `cargo-fuzz` targets for workflow YAML/templates, provider responses, MCP/A2A payload shapes, persisted state, and tool schemas/inputs. They use no network or credentials. Example:

```console
cargo install cargo-fuzz
cargo fuzz run workflow_yaml -- -max_total_time=60
```

The local hosted-CI configuration runs the canonical suite, credential-free acceptance, and packaging on Rust 1.88 for Linux x64, macOS arm64, and Windows x64. Separate automatic jobs cover the Linux x64 container, current vulnerability scan, two CycloneDX SBOM artifacts, complete-history/tree secret scans, dependency policy, and workflow lint. The workflows are locally linted but have not been pushed or dispatched, so this is configured evidence rather than validated hosted-platform support. Provider/protocol conformance uses local mock HTTP servers. Normal examples are deterministic; MCP/A2A runtime behavior is covered by mocks rather than requiring a background service.

The only full live gate is the separately invoked OpenAI acceptance described in [Providers](/agentctl/providers/). It performs two bounded Responses API requests locally and two in the OCI image for one tool-call/continuation journey each, then performs keyless replays. Never run it for debugging loops, fuzzing, load, or normal CI.
