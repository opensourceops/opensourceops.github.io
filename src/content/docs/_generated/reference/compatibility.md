## Preserved

Declaration-order scheduling among ready tasks, `needs` dataflow, exact typed templates, deterministic assign/assert/file/memory use cases, bounded agent/tool turns, approval concepts, SQLite local persistence, and the useful top-level command names remain. The language-neutral fixture records the legacy assign workflow’s translated model, graph order, and task reference. Omitted `foreach`, `matrix`, and `loop` fields preserve the unchanged single-task graph; compiled expansion metadata is additive.

## Migrated

The workflow document identifier changed from
`agentctl.dev/v1alpha1` to `agentctl.dev/v1` without changing the document
shape. Update the `apiVersion` line before upgrading; the retired identifier is
rejected with an explicit diagnostic. The separate pack-manifest identifier
remains `agentctl.dev/pack/v1alpha1`.

Unversioned `playbook:` YAML can be translated by `agentctl migrate`; `modules` become `actions`, `module:x` becomes `action:x`, heuristic agents map to the fake provider, and core memory/policy fields are normalized. Rust JSON output is a stable `agentctl.dev/cli/v1` envelope rather than the prototype JSONL/YAML mixture. The additive JSONL mode uses the same versioned envelopes for bounded progress and a final result. The production executable and runtime are Rust.

## Intentionally changed

`replay` now means no-effect recorded reconstruction. The prototype operation that created a new effectful run is `fork`. Unknown YAML fields, missing references, cycles, unsupported provider capabilities, invalid tool output, path escapes, unsafe processes/networks, and incompatible durable state now fail explicitly. Direct `--api-key` flags are removed; secret references are required. OpenAI uses current Responses concepts, and Anthropic/Google are native adapters rather than names on an OpenAI-compatible route.

Schema 5 adds selective-repair metadata without changing resume, replay, retry, or fork semantics. New runs persist task fingerprints, output contracts/digests, state deltas, artifacts, and disposition. Older runs migrate and remain inspectable, but tasks completed without metadata version 1 cannot be silently reused by repair.

Schema 14 preserves legacy long-term-memory values by wrapping them as typed
format-version-1 JSON entries with derived searchable text. Exact namespace/key
reads remain compatible. Text, vector, hybrid search, metadata, embedding
identity, and explicit promotion are additive.

## Deprecated and removed

Unversioned YAML is compatibility-only and warns. The TypeScript package exposes no `bin` or `main` and is archived. Placeholder memory adapters, provider environment-name-only “support,” YAML output, legacy profiles, automatic endpoint overrides, old prompt-cache fields, and optimistic replay semantics are removed from production.

Tool-level `compensation` metadata was never executable and is rejected. Declare
an effectful inverse action on each source task with `compensate`; see
[Compensation](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/68e5b8e738f099487c7af9fe1b043ab2c1a5d0b0/docs/guides/COMPENSATION.md).

Free-form `team:` orchestration is rejected. Convert each role to an explicit
agent task and each payload transfer to a typed handoff task; see
[Structured role handoffs](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/68e5b8e738f099487c7af9fe1b043ab2c1a5d0b0/docs/guides/STRUCTURED_HANDOFFS.md).

Legacy exact local pack references remain readable and warn until
`agentctl packs lock` writes `agentctl.pack.lock`. Convert `path` and
`integrity` fields to a typed `source`, select `packTrust.unsigned`, and review
`allowUnsignedProcess` before enabling any process-capable pack. Native dynamic
libraries are not supported; migrate local executors to `extension.process` or
remote tools to MCP.

Legacy workflows depending on broad built-in tool profiles, remote MCP/A2A
shape, MongoDB memory, provider-specific endpoint fields, or embedded
credentials require manual conversion. The translator intentionally refuses to
guess security-sensitive intent.

## Separate product decisions

A public pack registry, in-process plugin ABI, and general A2A resubmission are
not part of the workflow API v1 compatibility promise. Pack lock v1, the
bounded process protocol v1, and source/trust policy are additive. MCP
reconnect is bounded by explicit idempotency and schema stability. A2A
continuation observes only a persisted task ID. Bounded loops, namespaced
sub-workflows, explicit
source-linked compensation, graph-native structured handoffs, durable
streaming, and protocol continuation records are additive; hidden or
model-controlled orchestration is intentionally unsupported.
