The generated [workflow JSON Schema](/agentctl/downloads/workflow.schema.json) is authoritative. This page explains the field groups, defaults, and validation behavior that matter when writing YAML.

## Document envelope

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` | yes | Must be `agentctl.dev/v1`. |
| `kind` | yes | Must be `Workflow`. |
| `metadata.name` | yes | Stable human-readable workflow name. |
| `metadata.description` | no | Short purpose. |
| `metadata.labels` | no | String metadata map. |
| `spec` | yes | Workflow declarations and ordered tasks. |

Unknown fields fail. Documents, ordinary input files, packs, direct reads, existing write targets, and instruction files are limited to 1 MiB.

## Workflow declarations

| `spec` field | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inputs` | `{}` | Default JSON values supplied to templates. |
| `varsFiles` | `[]` | Ordered workflow variable files; later files replace earlier top-level values. |
| `vars` | `{}` | Inline workflow variables overriding workflow files. Inputs remain a separate namespace. |
| `outputs` | `{}` | Final values selected from inputs, memory, variables, or task outputs. |
| `providers` | `{}` | Named fake, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google adapters. |
| `agents` | `{}` | Named bounded model executors. |
| `actions` | `{}` | Named deterministic or protocol actions. |
| `tools` | `{}` | Strict model-callable tool contracts. |
| `subworkflows` | `{}` | Semantically versioned reusable task graphs with typed input and output boundaries. |
| `compensation` | manual, policy approval | Best-effort compensation trigger and approval behavior. |
| `tasks` | required list | Ordered graph nodes. |
| `policy` | safe defaults | Filesystem, process, network, provider, tool, and approval rules. |
| `memory` | empty | Initial working memory and optional typed long-term store, namespace, retention, and embedding configuration. |
| `mcpServers` | `{}` | Pinned MCP Streamable HTTP peers. |
| `a2aPeers` | `{}` | Pinned A2A Agent Card peers. |
| `packs` | `[]` | Semver-constrained local, pinned Git, or immutable archive pack roots. |
| `packTrust` | unsigned warning, process denied | Unsigned policy, Sigstore identity/issuer allowlist, and explicit unsigned-process acknowledgement. |
| `runtime` | bounded defaults | Runtime controls. `maxConcurrency` defaults to `1` and accepts `1` through `64`. |
| `output` | defaults | Output presentation contract. |

## Network policy

`policy.networkAllowlist` contains exact hosts or `*.suffix` subdomain rules.
The wildcard never matches the suffix apex. Every network action also uses the
following `policy.network` fields:

| Field | Default | Validation and behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowedSchemes` | `[https, http]` | Nonempty subset of `https` and `http`. |
| `allowedPorts` | `[]` | Empty permits the scheme's known or explicit port; otherwise the effective port must appear here. Port `0` is invalid. |
| `allowPrivate` | `false` | When false, private, loopback, link-local, shared, documentation, benchmark, unspecified, multicast, and reserved IPv4/IPv6 answers fail. |
| `allowProxy` | `false` | When false, environment proxy discovery is disabled. Enabling it explicitly trusts that proxy's routing and resolution. |
| `customCa` | none | Environment, mounted-file, or policy-gated process secret reference containing only PEM certificates. Environment references must appear in `environmentAllowlist`. |
| `connectTimeoutSeconds` | `10` | Bounds DNS resolution and TCP connection setup; valid range is 1 through 120. |
| `maxResponseBytes` | `8388608` | Upper network response bound; valid range is 1 through 67108864 and composes with lower adapter limits. |

Required provider, MCP, and A2A URLs are checked before a run record is
created. Agentctl resolves the destination, rejects the complete answer if any
address is forbidden, and pins all accepted addresses into the direct client.
Redirects and Unix-socket transports are disabled. See [Network
policy](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/42922f9479f9b9cda360c36cf9b113ae4ce50f9a/docs/guides/NETWORK_POLICY.md).

## Tasks

Each task requires `id` and `uses`. `uses` is `action:name`, `agent:name`,
`workflow:name`, or `router`.

| Field | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `needs` | `[]` | Every ID must exist; cycles fail. |
| `foreach` | none | Static typed `items`, binding `as`, and `maxItems`. Mutually exclusive with `matrix`; maximum 256 children. |
| `matrix` | none | Static `axes` Cartesian product and `maxItems`. Axis names are template-safe identifiers; maximum 256 children. |
| `route` | required for `uses: router` | Exact typed `select`, unique typed cases, enumerated destinations, and optional default destinations. Every destination must depend on the router. |
| `loop` | none | Required `maxIterations` from 1 through 64, exact typed `while`, and optional typed `initial` value. Mutually exclusive with `when`, `foreach`, `matrix`, and `route`. |
| `memoryWrites` | inferred or `[]` | Working-memory keys. Literal memory-write keys are inferred; templated keys require an explicit set. Unordered overlaps fail when concurrency is greater than one. |
| `when` | true | Constrained boolean/equality expression. |
| `varsFiles` | `[]` | Ordered task variable files overriding workflow and selected-agent defaults. |
| `vars` | `{}` | Task-local JSON values overriding task files. Explicit invocation variable overrides have higher priority. |
| `with` | `{}` | Typed action or agent input. |
| `outputSchema` | action-owned object or agent structured contract | Valid JSON Schema checked at task completion and selective-repair reuse. |
| `retry` | bounded default | Only definitive retry-safe failures may repeat. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | action or agent default | Must be within the implementation bound. |
| `compensate` | none | Named effectful action, typed `with`, bounded retry, and timeout. Valid only on a potentially mutating task. |
| failure behavior | fail | Unsupported dynamic control flow is rejected. |

`extension.process` actions require
`protocolVersion: agentctl.dev/process-extension/v1`, explicit idempotency,
input and output JSON Schemas, a declared capability list, direct command/args,
and bounded process limits. See [Extensions](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/42922f9479f9b9cda360c36cf9b113ae4ce50f9a/docs/EXTENSIONS.md).

Ready tasks are selected in YAML declaration order up to `maxConcurrency`.
They read isolated durable snapshots and commit in compiled order. There is no
runtime or model-controlled expansion. Static `foreach` and `matrix` tasks
compile to inspectable child tasks and a parent aggregate. Bounded loops
compile to a sequential child chain and parent aggregate. Sub-workflows compile
to namespaced ordinary tasks with typed input and output boundaries. There is
no handler or separate parallel group in this version. Compensation is planned
after a terminal run and executes declared inverse actions in reverse graph
order through an ordinary source-linked durable run.

## Agents

An agent requires `provider`, `model`, and exactly one of `instructions` or `instructionsFile`. Defaults are `maxTurns: 8`, `maxToolCalls: 16`, `maxOutputTokens: 2048`, and `timeoutSeconds: 120`. Set tighter values for known work. Optional fields include ordered `varsFiles`, inline `vars`, tools, retry, reasoning, structured output, usage limits, and provider-specific options.

Agent file defaults override workflow variables; agent inline values override
agent files. Task and explicit invocation variable layers follow. File paths
are literal and relative to the declaring workflow or pack manifest, while the
workspace read policy remains mandatory. Source bytes are captured before
compilation for instructions, variables, and recovery compatibility.
Instruction text expands the same templates as inline instructions. See
[Variables and instruction files](/agentctl/guides/variables/) for all eight precedence
layers, limits, merge rules, and source diagnostics.

`structuredOutput` asks the provider for typed JSON and becomes the default task output contract. A task-level `outputSchema` can define the complete task contract explicitly. An agent result that feeds downstream tasks must have one of these contracts before it can be reused by selective repair. Schema documents are compiled when the workflow is checked; values are validated both when completed and when reused.

Capability negotiation happens during compilation. A provider must explicitly support every requested feature.

## Runtime budgets

`runtime.maxConcurrency` defaults to `1`, and
`runtime.defaultTimeoutSeconds` defaults to `120`. Optional
`runtime.budgets` fields are `maxProviderRequests`, `maxTurns`,
`maxToolCalls`, `maxInputTokens`, `maxOutputTokens`, `maxTotalTokens`,
`maxWallTimeSeconds`, `maxProcessOutputBytes`, `maxArtifactBytes`,
`maxTasks`, `maxExpansionItems`, `maxLoopIterations`, and
`maxCostMicrousd`. Values must be greater than zero.

`maxCostMicrousd` requires `runtime.pricing.version` and a
`runtime.pricing.models` entry for every cost-limited `provider/model`.
Input and output rates are integer micro-US-dollars per million tokens.
Optional reasoning and cache rates fall back to output and input rates. See
[Resource and cost budgets](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/42922f9479f9b9cda360c36cf9b113ae4ce50f9a/docs/guides/RESOURCE_BUDGETS.md).

## Actions

Supported action kinds:

- `builtin.assign`
- `builtin.assert`
- `builtin.read`
- `builtin.write`
- `builtin.shell.exec`
- `builtin.memory.read`
- `builtin.memory.write`
- `builtin.long_term_memory.read`
- `builtin.long_term_memory.search`
- `builtin.long_term_memory.write`
- `builtin.long_term_memory.promote`
- `mcp.call`
- `a2a.delegate`

`builtin.shell.exec` uses a direct executable and argument list. Output defaults are 1 MiB per stream and 2 MiB combined, with a maximum configured value of 16 MiB. Its maximum timeout is 86,400 seconds.

Both process action kinds accept `isolation`. `process` is the default and
means bounded host execution, not sandboxing. `container` requires a
`container` block:

| Field | Default | Validation and behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | required | Local content address in `NAME@sha256:DIGEST` or `sha256:IMAGE_ID` form. Pulls are disabled. |
| `runtime` | `auto` | `auto`, `docker`, or `podman`. Explicit selection never falls back. |
| `memoryLimitBytes` | `268435456` | 16 MiB through 16 GiB. |
| `cpuLimitMillis` | `1000` | 1 through 64,000; 1,000 is one CPU. |
| `pidsLimit` | `64` | 1 through 4,096. |

Container mode fixes a read-only root and workspace mount, non-root user,
network none, dropped capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, bounded `/tmp`, and
direct entrypoint/arguments. The compiled plan exposes process requirements.
See [Process isolation](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/42922f9479f9b9cda360c36cf9b113ae4ce50f9a/docs/guides/PROCESS_ISOLATION.md).

`mcp.call` accepts an optional `idempotency` declaration. Only `pure`,
`idempotent`, or `keyed` permits the bounded reconnect path, and a refreshed
tool schema must match exactly. Omitted idempotency is `unknown`.

An A2A peer accepts `timeoutSeconds`, `maxPolls` from 1 through 1,000, and
`pollIntervalMs` from 1 through 60,000. Defaults are 120 seconds, 100 polls,
and 100 milliseconds. These bounds apply to observation of a known task;
`SendMessage` remains at most once.

## Long-term memory

`memory.longTerm` defaults to the built-in `sqlite` provider and `default`
namespace. `retentionDays`, when set, is 1 through 36,500. Its `embedding`
block defaults to `local_hash` with 64 dimensions and accepts 8 through 4096
dimensions. Any non-local embedding provider must name a compatible entry in
`spec.providers`. OpenAI embeddings also require `embedding.model`.

Memory writes accept a versioned `entry`, a typed `content` block, or a legacy
`value` plus optional searchable `text` and metadata. Search accepts exact
metadata filters and `text`, `vector`, or `hybrid` mode, with a result limit
from 1 through 100. Promotion is a separate internal-state action and requires
its working-memory key in `memoryWrites` when the key is templated. See
[State and memory](/agentctl/concepts/memory/).

## Tools

A tool requires `kind`, description, strict input and output JSON Schema, capability, risk, effect class, idempotency, retry safety, timeout, and approval behavior. Built-in tool executors are workspace read, workspace write, and echo. Declared semantics must match the built-in kind.

## Templates and conditions

Allowed template roots are:

```text
${{ inputs.path }}
${{ vars.path }}
${{ memory.path }}
${{ tasks.task-id.output.path }}
```

An exact template preserves objects, arrays, booleans, numbers, strings, and null. Text interpolation accepts scalars. Conditions add `not`, type-sensitive `==` and `!=`, and numeric `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`. There is no code execution, arithmetic, arbitrary function, indexing, or implicit dependency.

## Secret references

Provider credentials, action environment values, and protocol headers use
`{ env: NAME }`, `{ file: PATH }`, or a bounded `{ process: ... }` reference.
The source description is stored in the workflow, but the value is resolved
only at the execution boundary. File and process sources require explicit
`secretFileRoots` or `secretProcessAllowlist` policy. See
[Secret references](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/42922f9479f9b9cda360c36cf9b113ae4ce50f9a/docs/guides/SECRET_REFERENCES.md).

## Example and validation

See `examples/v1/dataflow.yaml` for typed inputs and task outputs. From the repository root:

```text
agentctl check examples/v1/dataflow.yaml
agentctl plan examples/v1/dataflow.yaml
agentctl run examples/v1/dataflow.yaml --db /tmp/dataflow.db --output json --color never
```
