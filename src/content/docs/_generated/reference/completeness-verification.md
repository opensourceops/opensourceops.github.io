This record accumulates sanitized evidence for the framework-completeness
program. It contains no credentials, raw provider responses, prompt
transcripts, runtime databases, private certificates, or artifact bytes.

## Baseline

Branch point: `af9b4ae`, including independently reviewed selective workflow
repair.

Date: 2026-07-23, Asia/Kolkata.

| Gate | Baseline result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo xtask verify` | passed all 12 stages |
| `cargo xtask acceptance` | passed 28 scenarios |
| `cargo xtask examples-verify` | passed |
| `cargo xtask docs-verify` | passed all 6 stages |
| `cargo xtask package` | passed for macOS arm64 |
| `cargo xtask secret-scan` | passed |
| `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY cargo xtask acceptance-container` | reached the OCI CLI, then failed because `/artifacts/report.txt` escaped the authorized workspace root |

The installed container runtime is Podman 5.8.2 with a libkrun machine. In this
execution environment, Podman's VM and forwarding processes survive only while
the starting terminal remains open. Keeping that terminal active made the
engine reachable without deleting a machine, changing TLS, or weakening
configuration.

No OpenAI request was made during baseline verification.

## Semantic-memory checkpoint

Date: 2026-07-27, Asia/Kolkata.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo xtask verify` | passed all 12 stages; 14 CLI, 55 core, 21 provider, 80 runtime, 31 store, and 15 protocol tests passed |
| `cargo xtask acceptance` | passed all 43 credential-free packaged CLI scenarios |
| `cargo xtask docs-verify` | passed all 6 stages |
| `cargo xtask examples-verify` | passed |
| `cargo xtask package` | passed for macOS arm64 |
| `cargo xtask secret-scan` | passed |

All deterministic commands ran with `OPENAI_API_KEY` removed. The optional
OpenAI embedding adapter used only WireMock contract tests, so this checkpoint
made zero OpenAI API requests.

## Process-isolation checkpoint

Date: 2026-07-27, Asia/Kolkata.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` | passed without warnings |
| `cargo test -p agentctl-core --lib` | passed all 63 tests |
| `cargo test -p agentctl-store --lib` | passed all 35 tests |
| `cargo test -p agentctl-runtime --lib` | passed 90 tests; one live container test ignored by default |
| `cargo test -p agentctl-runtime process::tests::` | passed all 8 process lifecycle, cleanup, and container-contract tests |
| `cargo xtask acceptance` | passed all 46 credential-free packaged CLI scenarios |
| `cargo xtask resource-budget-live-openai` | passed with one GPT-5.6 request, 18 input tokens, and 5 output tokens; second request denied |
| `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY cargo xtask acceptance-container` | blocked before image build because Podman 5.8.2/libkrun `gvproxy` exited and both the configured TCP endpoint and forwarded Unix socket refused connections |

The existing Podman VM was started and then cleanly stopped/restarted once.
The VM booted, but its forwarding process exited immediately on both attempts.
No image or container was started by this checkpoint. The OCI gate now includes
a real digest-pinned action-level container test and must be rerun when the
local engine is healthy.

## OCI completion checkpoint

Date: 2026-07-27, Asia/Kolkata.

The existing Podman machine was recovered without deleting it or changing its
security configuration. Its libkrun and `gvproxy` processes remained available
while the starting terminal stayed open.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test -p xtask` | passed all 7 tests, including Docker/Podman image-ID normalization and malformed-ID rejection |
| `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY cargo xtask acceptance-container` | passed on Podman 5.8.2, native Linux arm64 |
| Trivy 0.72.0 HIGH/CRITICAL fixed-vulnerability gate | passed with a freshly updated database and zero findings |
| Trivy 0.72.0 CycloneDX generation and `jq` validation | passed; 11 components, 20,821 bytes |
| Image configuration and history marker scan | passed; zero credential, authorization, bearer, or token-pattern lines |

The first current-source run built the image and exposed a product-gate
compatibility defect: Podman 5.8 returned `.Id` as bare 64-hex while the
acceptance parser required Docker's `sha256:` prefix. The parser now validates
both forms, normalizes both to `sha256:<digest>`, and rejects every malformed
form. The cached rerun passed action-level digest-pinned isolation, strict tool
continuation, declared artifact export, durable inspection, parallel ordered
commit, selective repair, network-disabled replay, missing credentials,
invalid input, SIGTERM, non-root identity, read-only root, and mounted state
and artifacts.

The exact image is Linux arm64, `nonroot:nonroot`, version `0.2.0`, and source
`opensourceops/agentctl`. Its local image digest is
`sha256:ddcf174ab2b1ce2481395380d482292a41d79ee5f4620fd52cbd3733e712127c`.
The ignored SBOM at
`.runtime/scan/agentctl-framework-completeness.cdx.json` has SHA-256
`0ee27f16491108f0f018ac2bc7ad201b3f97bdb539cd6b78584264c9eedd67ff`.
No OpenAI request occurred.

## Composite and live checkpoint

Date: 2026-07-27, Asia/Kolkata.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY cargo xtask completeness` | passed all three packaged composite groups |
| `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY cargo xtask acceptance-container` | passed the durable composite and compensation/reconciliation additions on native Linux arm64 |
| `cargo xtask examples-verify-live-openai` local phase | passed every public OpenAI example and the 11-request framework composite |
| `cargo xtask examples-verify-live-openai-container` | passed the focused native Linux arm64 live source, repair, and keyless replay continuation |

The deterministic gate verified approval, parallel scheduling, a four-child
matrix, typed agent output, failed-only retry, repair after workspace artifact
deletion, CAS verify/export, keyless replay, sub-workflows, a two-iteration
loop, typed routing, MCP reconnect, compensation, reconciliation,
cancellation, and structured handoffs.

The retained GPT-5.6 matrix used 27 requests, 3,939 input tokens, 560 output
tokens, 20 reasoning tokens, and 8 tool calls. It covered basic and tool
workflows, two agent branches, a two-child agent matrix, structured routing,
an agent loop, an agent sub-workflow, a typed two-role handoff, a deterministic
agent failure and failed-only retry, selective repair, artifact CAS reuse,
keyless replay, real streaming, and Linux arm64 container execution. The
separate one-request resource-budget run denied request two before dispatch.
See
[`LIVE_FRAMEWORK_VERIFICATION.md`](/agentctl/reference/live-framework-verification/)
for run IDs, cumulative request accounting, and fail-closed gate corrections.

Two acceptance defects were corrected before closure. Repair planning now
returns a structured `resolved_input_unavailable` block instead of aborting
when an earlier incompatible reused task makes a downstream template
unresolvable. The live OCI gate now copies the actual public OpenAI repair
workflows rather than the credential-free fixture with unrelated task IDs.

## Evidence rules

- Deterministic gates run without provider credentials.
- Live gates use only `gpt-5.6`, at most 80 Responses API requests for this
  program, and a target aggregate cost below USD 15.
- Live records retain only scenario, model, request/tool counts, token counts,
  run ID, outcome, and recovery/replay reuse status.
- Raw model content, databases, and keys stay in ignored local evidence.
- Configured hosted jobs are not described as executed.
- Native and emulated container architecture results are labeled explicitly.
- Every verified limitation links to focused tests plus at least one public
  product path.

## Final adversarial review

Status: passed with no unresolved P0, P1, or scoped P2 finding.

The clean pass reviewed security and secret handling, all retained migrations,
effect and reconciliation safety, artifact integrity, concurrent scheduling,
retry/repair/replay lineage, provider continuation, protocol reconnect, pack
trust, selected-field encryption, budgets, container behavior, every public
example, live evidence, hosted workflow coverage, and public claims.

It found zero P0s, three P1s, and five scoped P2s. The P1s were a repair plan
that aborted instead of returning a blocked-input diagnostic, an OCI live gate
that copied the wrong repair fixture, and a live continuation that could check
an existing cost overrun only after dispatch. The scoped P2s were
model/tool-effect miscounting, a two-write evidence completion window, a
missing documented artifact-store command, missing completeness execution in
the hosted matrices, and stale pre-burn-down public status text. All findings
were fixed and covered by focused tests or local validation. The final
credential-free gates, actionlint, deterministic secret scan, native Linux
arm64 OCI acceptance, exact-image Trivy/SBOM checks, and retained GPT-5.6
evidence are green.
