The local SQLite database and its sibling artifact root are history and part of the correctness boundary. The current database schema version is `15`.

## Stored records

- runs, source workflow, compiled plan, inputs, output, mode, state, parent linkage, and repair/retry source/root metadata
- task states, attempts, output, errors, disposition, source attempt, versioned fingerprints/digests, state delta, artifact manifest, reuse decision, and encrypted-capable execution memory snapshot
- effects, request/result/error, confirmation, and uncertainty
- immutable effect reconciliation history, operator authorization, evidence, validated results, supersession, and compensation linkage
- approvals and resolutions
- checksummed checkpoints
- ordered audit and trace events
- run-wide budget limits, planned graph counts, actual usage, active
  reservations, reconciliation sources, and exceeded dimension
- provider sessions and tool calls
- MCP/A2A sessions and calls with remote identity, generation, continuation status, and replay linkage
- typed namespaced long-term memory with format version, searchable text,
  metadata, embedding provider/dimensions/vector, creation time, and optional
  expiry
- content-addressed blob metadata, logical run/task references, provenance, verification time, and bounded ingestion leases
- legacy-run upgrade analysis and the exact task metadata applied by each upgrade

Working memory is stored on the run and in checkpoints. Provider credentials and state-encryption key values are not stored. Prompts, workflow inputs and outputs, task output and errors, effect input/results, approvals, checkpoints, audit/trace payloads, provider continuations, reconciliation evidence, and long-term-memory values can be protected with application-level authenticated envelopes.

Migration 5 adds `source_run_id`, `source_workflow_digest`, repair roots/reason/version, and task-boundary metadata used by repair. Migration 6 adds artifact blob, reference, and ingestion-lease tables. Migration 7 records transactional legacy-run upgrades. Migration 8 adds immutable effect reconciliation records. Migration 9 adds retry roots/reason/version and failed-only selection. Migration 10 adds state-encryption configuration and fail-closed write guards. Migration 11 adds the protected execution-memory snapshot used to preserve parallel task boundaries across crashes and approvals. Migration 12 adds encrypted-capable bounded provider stream events with task-attempt and replay-source sequence linkage. Migration 13 adds encrypted-capable MCP/A2A session and call records with generation, remote identity, status, and replay-source linkage. Migration 14 upgrades legacy long-term-memory values to typed format-versioned entries and adds searchable text, metadata, embedding identity/vector, creation time, and a namespace/expiry search index. Migration 15 adds per-run budget snapshots and idempotent effect reservations; retained runs receive an unlimited ledger with existing task counts. Embedding vectors are encryption-capable selected fields. A repair or retry transaction creates the run, materializes every reused task and artifact reference, creates pending fresh tasks, records provenance audit events, initializes its budget ledger, and writes its first checkpoint atomically. Protocol lineage is copied for materialized tasks before execution begins. The source identifier is durable lineage rather than a foreign-key dependency, so source garbage collection does not delete the derived run.

Artifact manifests contain logical path/name, media type, byte size, SHA-256 digest, and CAS-relative path. Blob bytes live under `<database-parent>/artifacts/sha256/`; identical content is stored once. A completed repair/replay receives its own references, so source-row and workspace deletion do not break it.

## Migrations

The store reads SQLite `user_version` and applies forward migrations in order inside transactions. A database newer than the binary fails explicitly. Corrupt or incompatible serialized state also fails explicitly.

```

`db migrate` and encryption enable/rotation may write the database. Back up the database and its WAL state before an upgrade. An encrypted backup requires the referenced key value; the database stores only the key ID and environment-variable name. Retire pre-encryption backups and snapshots according to their confidentiality requirements.

## Locking and permissions

The connection enables foreign keys, WAL mode, and a five-second busy timeout. Unix database files use mode `0600`. Windows relies on user-profile ACLs. Artifact ingestion and GC use an advisory cross-process lock plus SQLite leases; this protects the local store but is not a distributed lease. Separate runs can share a database but can still change the same external resource.

## Backups and recovery

Use an SQLite-aware online backup or stop writers before copying the database, WAL files, and sibling `artifacts/` directory. Restore the set consistently. Do not use ordinary file synchronization that can separate SQLite from uncheckpointed WAL content or the artifact bytes referenced by it.

Delete old terminal history only after retention requirements are met:

```text
agentctl gc --db .agentctl/runtime.db --older-than-days 30 --output json --color never
agentctl artifacts --db .agentctl/runtime.db gc --older-than-days 30 --output json --color never
```
