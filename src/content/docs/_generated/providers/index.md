The core defines provider-neutral messages, text/reasoning/tool content, strict tool schemas, tool calls/results, finish reasons, usage, and opaque continuation. The compiler compares each agent’s requested structured output, tools, reasoning, cache, and continuation needs with typed provider capabilities.

| Kind | Native API | Implemented behavior | Credential default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fake` | in-process scripted provider | deterministic echo/script, tool path, usage, typed streaming | none |
| `openai` | Responses API | Explicit compatible model; strict function tools and structured output; multiple call IDs; stored and stateless continuation; reasoning effort/mode/context; prompt-cache mode/TTL; input/output/reasoning/cache metrics; typed SSE streaming | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `azure_openai` | Azure `/openai/v1/responses?api-version=v1` | OpenAI mapping and SSE with Azure `api-key`; explicit endpoint required | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | Messages API | native content/tool/thinking blocks, structured output instruction, usage and stop mapping | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `google` | Gemini `generateContent` | native contents/function declarations/calls/results, thought-signature continuation, response schema, token usage | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |

Endpoints must pass the workflow scheme, host, effective-port, and resolved-IP
policy. Every DNS answer must be allowed, and direct clients pin the accepted
answer to prevent resolution drift. Private addresses and environment proxies
are denied by default. Redirects and Unix-socket transports are disabled.
Response bytes and DNS/connect time are bounded, composed with the provider
task timeout and the adapter's lower hard limit. See [Network
policy](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/30167c8330b1a3fb0bb89c2426d6310e1efd6aa4/docs/guides/NETWORK_POLICY.md).
Credentials and configured headers accept environment, mounted-file, or
policy-gated process references. Provider credentials in the fresh execution
closure are preflighted before a new run record or effect; custom headers
resolve while building a required adapter.
Standard authentication headers override custom headers. Successful/error
response JSON keys and values plus provider request IDs are scrubbed of
configured secrets before parsing or persistence. Calls honor timeout and
cancellation. See [Secret references](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/30167c8330b1a3fb0bb89c2426d6310e1efd6aa4/docs/guides/SECRET_REFERENCES.md).

`agentctl providers inspect <workflow>` reports declared capabilities without calling a service. OpenAI has the broadest mock request/response/tool/usage/error coverage. Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have native mapping and focused mock-protocol coverage at the maturity shown below; normal tests have no credentials. Live provider workflows are opt-in: historical examples end in `-live.yaml`, while the four DevOps variants use `openai.workflow.yaml`.

| Provider | Validation level in this tree |
| --- | --- |
| Fake | deterministic in-process runtime and acceptance tested |
| OpenAI | native adapter mock-protocol tested; historical bounded GPT-5.6 tool workflow live-tested; new-source evidence tracked separately |
| Azure OpenAI | native adapter request/auth/response mapping mock-tested; not live-tested |
| Anthropic | native text/tool/usage mapping mock-tested; not live-tested |
| Google | native text/function/usage mapping mock-tested; not live-tested |

The provider-only `agentctl providers smoke-openai --live --model MODEL`
diagnostic is not runtime acceptance and does not participate in the shared
launch-suite harness. The launch sequence uses the budgeted xtask gates in
[Testing](/agentctl/contributing/testing/#explicit-paid-gates), with explicit
`AGENTCTL_LIVE_BUDGET` and `AGENTCTL_LIVE_MODEL` settings. All paid invocations
and retries must share that persistent ledger.

`cargo xtask acceptance-live-openai` runs compilation, SQLite, a real strict
function call, tool policy/schema validation, stateless encrypted-reasoning
continuation, assertion/artifact creation, inspection, and provider-keyless
replay. It repeats the journey in the production OCI image and requires a
usable container engine. `cargo xtask examples-verify-live-openai` runs the
legacy public OpenAI inventory plus the canonical two-agent repair. A repaired
task starts a new Responses session; the failed source task's response ID,
continuation items, pending tool call, and reasoning state are not copied.
Validated task output remains the cross-run dataflow boundary.

`cargo xtask resource-budget-live-openai` allows one dispatch with the explicitly
selected compatible model, durably denies the second requested model effect,
and verifies the provider-request ledger through public inspection. The four
DevOps OpenAI variants separately use `gpt-5-mini` by explicit runner selection.
Routine legacy feature gates select `gpt-5.6-sol`; an authorized compatibility
case may select `gpt-6-astra` when the account supports it. None of these model
names is a claim that all corresponding gates have passed on the current
source. Native Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google coverage remains mock-based.

The shared launch allowance is 100 requests, 200,000 total tokens, 1,800 seconds
of paid execution, and US$25 estimated cost. The legacy example gate retains
its additional 40-request/US$10 guard. Local and OCI wrappers reserve before
dispatch, reconcile complete durable usage, and retain uncertain reservations.
Unknown accounting fails the gate even if the child CLI returned success.
Reviewed price schedules are versioned operator inputs. Unpriced model
selections fail closed; estimates are not invoices. See the [current execution
ledger](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/30167c8330b1a3fb0bb89c2426d6310e1efd6aa4/docs/execution/AUTONOMOUS_LAUNCH_READINESS.md) for actual live results and
usage, rather than treating earlier GPT-5.6 evidence as a new-source result.

OpenAI provider options are an allowlisted map (`store`, `reasoningContext`, `promptCacheMode`, `promptCacheTtl`, `parallelToolCalls`, and `safetyIdentifier`). Unknown options or invalid values fail compilation. Tool-using OpenAI and Azure OpenAI agents may set `store: false`; the adapter requests encrypted reasoning content and replays the complete ordered response-item and function-output history. `stream: true` selects typed Responses SSE for fake, OpenAI, and Azure OpenAI agents. Anthropic and Google streaming fail capability negotiation. Programmatic tool calling remains unsupported and fails rather than being ignored. Parallel function calls are parsed and correlated, but one agent task executes them serially in response order. Independent workflow tasks can use bounded parallel scheduling.

## Stateful and stateless continuation

With the default `store: true`, OpenAI continuation uses `previous_response_id`.
The next request sends only the latest function outputs and relies on the
provider-stored response.

With `store: false`, agentctl does not send `previous_response_id`. It
automatically requests `reasoning.encrypted_content`, normalizes each returned
reasoning, message, and function-call item into the provider-neutral
continuation, and replays those items in their original order with correlated
function outputs, following the official [stateless encrypted-reasoning
contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/methods/create).
A returned reasoning item without encrypted content fails closed instead of
silently losing model context.

Both modes persist continuation under provider-session format version 1.
Stateless request input is capped at 8 MiB before dispatch. Provider responses
remain subject to the configured response-byte limit and the 4 MiB adapter hard
limit. Continuation and model-effect payloads use the selected-field
state-encryption boundary when state encryption is enabled. Repair starts a
fresh provider session, while pause/resume restores the task-local continuation
and recorded replay performs no provider dispatch.

Cost is not inferred when a provider returns no reliable cost metadata.
Agent `maxCostUsd` and run `maxCostMicrousd` can use explicit versioned custom
pricing keyed by `provider/model`; otherwise a requested monetary limit fails
capability negotiation. Token-only run budgets remain enforceable from native
usage without pricing. Retry is limited to explicit task bounds and definitive
retryable HTTP responses. Timeout, cancellation, or a transport loss after
dispatch is considered ambiguous and is not automatically reissued. See
[Resource and cost budgets](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/30167c8330b1a3fb0bb89c2426d6310e1efd6aa4/docs/guides/RESOURCE_BUDGETS.md).

Streaming persists each accepted fragment before reading more transport data.
Records are bounded and redacted, while the terminal response still follows
the normal validation path. See [Durable provider
streaming](https://github.com/opensourceops/agentctl/blob/30167c8330b1a3fb0bb89c2426d6310e1efd6aa4/docs/guides/DURABLE_STREAMING.md).
