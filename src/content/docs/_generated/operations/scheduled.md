Scheduling belongs to the external platform. `agentctl` owns deterministic execution, SQLite history, overlap-safe database access, effects, outputs, recovery, and diagnostics; it does not own clocks, calendars, leader election, log rotation, or distributed leases.

## Non-interactive contract

- Do not pass `--interactive` from cron or CI.
- Use `--output json --color never` for one parseable final document on stdout. Errors use the same versioned envelope on stderr.
- Set explicit `--workspace`, `--db`, artifact inputs, and `--timeout-seconds`.
- A pending approval is persisted and exits `3`; it never waits on stdin. Use `approvals list`, an operator-controlled `approve` or `reject`, and then `resume` with the same database and workspace.
- Success is `0`, validation is `2`, policy/approval is `3`, run failure is `4`, persistence is `5`, provider/protocol failure is `6`, and cancellation is `130`.
- Output/error correlation includes a run ID and trace ID whenever a run exists.

## Cron

Use absolute paths and an external overlap lock when two schedules must not affect the same resource:

```text
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /var/lib/agentctl/report.lock /usr/local/bin/agentctl run /etc/agentctl/report.yaml --workspace /srv/app --db /var/lib/agentctl/runtime.db --inputs-file /etc/agentctl/inputs.json --timeout-seconds 600 --output json --color never >>/var/log/agentctl/report.jsonl 2>>/var/log/agentctl/report.err
```

The administrator owns log rotation and restrictive file permissions. Provider keys belong in the scheduler's protected environment, never in the crontab command line.

## systemd timer

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/agentctl-report.service
[Unit]
Description=Run the reviewed agentctl report workflow

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=agentctl
EnvironmentFile=/etc/agentctl/provider.env
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/agentctl run /etc/agentctl/report.yaml --workspace /srv/app --db /var/lib/agentctl/runtime.db --inputs-file /etc/agentctl/inputs.json --timeout-seconds 600 --output json --color never
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/agentctl /srv/agentctl-artifacts
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/agentctl-report.timer
[Unit]
Description=Schedule the agentctl report workflow

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:0/15
Persistent=true
Unit=agentctl-report.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

A oneshot service has one active invocation at a time. Use distinct databases only when independent histories are intended.

## Recovery

1. Capture the final JSON/error envelope and run/trace IDs.
2. Run `agentctl inspect RUN_ID --db PATH --output json`.
3. Resolve a pending approval, then `resume`; never use `fork` as an implicit retry.
4. Use `replay` for a no-effect reconstruction of a terminal run.
5. Use `fork` for a new run that may execute fresh effects.
6. For an uncertain effect, reconcile the remote system first. The runtime intentionally refuses unsafe resume.

Use `agentctl gc --db PATH --older-than-days N` for expired memory and old terminal histories after the organization's retention/backup requirements are satisfied. SQLite WAL files belong with the database during backup. A future schedule-run key may improve deduplication; today the external scheduler owns overlap prevention.
