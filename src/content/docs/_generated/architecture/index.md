```

`agentctl-core` owns deterministic domain behavior: strict parsing, migration, compilation, template resolution, effect identities, state machines, policy, and provider/tool interfaces. It knows no HTTP client, database, or CLI type. `agentctl-store` is the SQLite implementation. `agentctl-runtime` schedules one stable ready task at a time and coordinates injected clocks, IDs, executors, providers, protocols, persistence, and traces. Concrete network adapters and rendering stay at the edges.

## Execution

Parsing produces a versioned `Workflow`; compilation resolves references, validates provider capabilities and templates, detects cycles, and emits declaration-order topological tasks plus a digest. The runtime creates durable run/task rows, advances only valid state transitions, evaluates conditions, renders inputs, and executes the selected action or bounded agent.

An effect request is persisted before any filesystem observation/mutation, process, internal-memory update, long-term-memory operation, tool, model, MCP, or A2A call. Its stable identity covers run, task, task attempt, ordinal, operation, and input digest. A confirmed result can be reused on resume. A started but unconfirmed effect is uncertain and stops recovery rather than being repeated.

State transitions, checkpoint creation, working-memory replacement, and audit insertion are transactionally coupled where consistency requires it. Provider continuation, function-call correlation, effects, approvals, and redacted trace events are inspectable through the public CLI. Long-term memory is a separate table and never participates in replay correctness. OpenTelemetry export remains optional and is not the audit log.

## Determinism and concurrency

Ready tasks are ordered by YAML declaration order after dependencies. `maxConcurrency` currently must be `1`. Parallel execution, loops, matrix/foreach expansion, routers, sub-workflows, handlers, compensation execution, and event triggers are deferred because deterministic merge and recovery semantics are not yet frozen. The DSL carries optional compensation metadata on a tool contract, but the runtime does not execute compensation.

Clock and identifier generation are injected. Provider responses, tools, and external actions are injected interfaces. Cryptographic digests canonicalize identity; output maps use stable ordering where the public contract requires it.

## Platform and packaging

The workspace uses Rust edition 2024, pins Rust 1.88 as the MSRV, forbids unsafe code, and denies clippy warnings. HTTP uses rustls and disables redirects. Subprocesses use direct argv, a cleared environment, explicit allowlists, validated timeout/output limits, concurrent bounded pipe draining, cancellation, and kill/reap cleanup. SQLite is bundled for predictable installation and creates private files on Unix. SIGINT and SIGTERM converge on durable cancellation.

The OCI build is multi-stage: only the optimized Rust binary enters a maintained distroless runtime with CA roots and a non-root identity. `/config` is workflow configuration, `/workspace` is the read-only working tree, `/state` holds SQLite, and `/artifacts` receives declared outputs. State must be mounted again for inspect/resume/replay. The root filesystem may be read-only. See [Container contract](/agentctl/guides/container/) and ADR 0007.
